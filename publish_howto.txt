Notes for me to remember steps involved in publishing this package

- adjust version number in VERSION

- commit everything and push to github

- check that documentation builds on RTD

- make bundle by running:
    - You probably want to cleanup
    python setup.py clean --all
    rm -rf dist
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

- upload to TEST pypi
twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

- upload to official pypi repo
twine upload dist/*

For CONDA package

- go in conda_build directory 
        Command for adding conda build tools
        conda install anaconda-client conda-build
  run
conda skeleton pypi domplotutils
conda build domutils
    this will automatically upload to anaconda.org

        - Can test local build with:
        conda install -c file:///home/ords/mrd/rpndat/dja001/python_miniconda3/envs/test1/conda-bld/ domutils
        
        - test the conda package in a frest conda environment with:
        conda install -c dja001 domutils
